 Line Following Robot

Robot Type
Line Following Robot

Chosen Motor
DC Gear Motor

 Reason for Choosing
The DC gear motor provides sufficient torque at a low speed, which is ideal for a line-following robot. 
It ensures stable movement, precise control, and the ability to handle small inclines or uneven surfaces without losing track of the line.

 How to Use
1. Connect the motors and IR sensors to your Arduino as defined in the code pins.
2. Upload `line_following_robot.ino` to your Arduino board.
3. Place the robot on a track with a clear black line.
4. Power the robot and watch it follow the line!
